# React / Redux Training

## Introduction

This repository provides a series of lessons to supplement a six hour
in-class React / Redux training course.

The assumption is that you are already familiar with the basics of HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript and is interested in getting up to speed with the
React / Redux framework.

As to why learn the React / Redux framework, here is the short argument:

1) You are building a *web application* vs. a *web site*.
2) The web application is non-trivial.
3) You are concerned about long-term management of the web application.

The longer argument is provided by Facebook (recommend that you watch on
your own).

This repository is organized into a series of lessons; one per branch (each
with its own *README.md* file). The remaining files in the branch provide
the final result of the lesson.

To continue to the first lesson, select the branch named *lesson_1*.
