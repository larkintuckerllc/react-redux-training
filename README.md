# React / Redux Training

This branch is one lesson in a series of lessons to supplement a six hour
in-class React / Redux training course; switch to the *master* branch
to start the series.

This lesson will focus on JavaScript modules; self-contained code that
provides some functionality.

## RequireJS

**Assignment:** Setup development environment by following the steps:

1. In the *react-redux-training* folder create a folder called *lesson_2*.

and accept all default.
3. Run `npm install --save-dev eslint`.
4. Run `node_modules/.bin/eslint --init` using the popular style *Standard*.
